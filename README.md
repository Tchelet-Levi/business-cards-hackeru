# Business Card project for HackerU

This repository contains the source code for the Business Card project assignment for HackerU.

It is written in Typescript and uses the following libraries ( among others ) :

###### Front:

- React

- React Redux

- React Router (v6)

- React Helmet

- Zod

- Material UI (MUI)

###### Back:

- JOI

- Bcrypt

- ExpressJS

- Mongoose

- JsonWebToken

As someone who loves SASS and CSS, I also understand that I need to learn to use component libraries such as MUI, and so a big focus in this project was to not write CSS as much as possible.

I have learned many things while working on the project, and admittedly, I should've been more clear with myself about the requirements for the project instead of introducing more and more features. If I was more organized, I would've written better code.

### How to use:

**Warning: You must have [mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/) installed on your machine for this project to work.**

1. First, `cd` into both client and server and run `npm install` on everything.

2. Once the dependencies are all downloaded, `cd` into client and run `npm build`.

3. Then finally, `cd` into server and run `npm start`.
