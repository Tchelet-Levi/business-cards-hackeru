# Business Card project for HackerU

This repository contains the source code for the Business Card project assignment for HackerU.
It is written in Typescript and uses the following libraries ( among others ) :

###### Front:

- React
- React Redux
- React Router (v6)
- React Helmet
- Zod
- Material UI (MUI)

###### Back:

- JOI
- Bcrypt
- ExpressJS
- Mongoose
- JsonWebToken

As someone who loves SASS and CSS, I also understand that I need to learn to use component libraries such as MUI, and so a big focus in this project was to not write CSS as much as possible.

I have learned many things while working on the project, and admittedly, I should've been more clear with myself about the requirements for the project instead of introducing more and more features. If I was more organized, I would've written better code.
